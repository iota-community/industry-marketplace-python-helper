# Industry Marketplace Python Client Library

## This is a work in progress, it's not finished or feature complete yet, PR's welcome!

This helper class will allow you to easily create Industry Marketplace
Service providers or Service requesters with custom implementations.

The provided examples `service_provider.py` and `service_requester.py` can be 
altered to your needs.

For each instance you need a Industry Marketplace ServiceApp running as well;
Which can be found here: https://github.com/iotaledger/industry-marketplace/

## Installation

Using Python 3.6+ install the requirements with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run `python service_provider.py` for a service provider, or
`python service_requester.py` for a service requester.
